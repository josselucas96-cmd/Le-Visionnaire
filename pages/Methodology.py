<div class="about-body">

<p>
Every figure on this site is derived from one ledger, written once a day by an automated job and never
edited afterwards. This page describes how that ledger is built, how performance and risk are computed
from it, and — because a public track record is only worth what its accountability is worth — every
correction ever applied to it.
</p>

<div class="section-title">1. The paper portfolios</div>
<p>
Each portfolio starts with a notional <strong>USD 1,000,000</strong> deposited the evening before its
inception date. No real money is involved. Trades are simulated at the quoted price at the time the
decision is recorded; there are no transaction costs, no slippage, no taxes and no financing costs.
Positions are sized as a percentage of the initial capital and expressed in fractional shares.
</p>

<div class="section-title">2. The ledger</div>
<p>
The ledger holds, for each portfolio and each calendar day, one row per position
(<em>shares × closing price = value</em>) plus one cash row. The net asset value (NAV) of a day is the
sum of those rows. Rows are written after the US close by a scheduled job (22:07 UTC) and are
<strong>immutable</strong>: a trade made today changes today's row and the following ones, never the past.
</p>
<div class="kv">
<b>Price source</b><span>Yahoo Finance end-of-day closes (unadjusted for dividends).</span>
<b>Currency</b><span>All values in USD. Foreign listings are converted at that day's exchange rate; London prices quoted in pence are divided by 100.</span>
<b>Weekends &amp; holidays</b><span>A row is written every calendar day so that the Bitcoin benchmark (24/7) and the equity books stay on the same timeline. On non-trading days the last close is carried forward — those days carry no return.</span>
<b>Missing bars</b><span>If the provider has no close for a listing on a trading day, the last valid close is carried forward and the row is marked as propagated.</span>
<b>Cash</b><span>Derived from the previous day's cash row and the day's trades. A purchase that would take cash below zero is refused.</span>
</div>

<div class="section-title">3. Performance</div>
<p>
The chart and the headline return are indexed to <strong>100 on the last trading day before inception</strong>
(the "T-1 anchor": capital deposited the evening before, invested at the next open). The headline
figure is <em>NAV on the latest ledger day ÷ 1,000,000 − 1</em>. Benchmarks are indexed to 100 on the
same anchor day, and alpha is the difference between the two on the <strong>same date</strong>.
</p>
<div class="kv">
<b>Le Visionnaire</b><span>Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), secondary S&amp;P 500 (SPY)</span>
<b>Le Bâtisseur</b><span>S&amp;P 500 (SPY), secondary Nasdaq 100 (QQQ)</span>
<b>Le Nakamoto</b><span>Bitcoin (BTC-USD), secondary Strategy (MSTR)</span>
</div>
<p>
<strong>A known asymmetry, disclosed rather than hidden:</strong> the benchmark ETFs are measured on a
total-return basis (dividends reinvested), while the portfolios are measured on a price basis — cash
dividends are <em>not</em> credited to the ledger. This biases the comparison <em>against</em> the
portfolios, by roughly the dividend yield of the book (most material for Le Bâtisseur). Crediting
dividends at the ex-date is on the roadmap; when it lands it will be logged below. The "Return %" shown
per position does include reinvested dividends.
</p>

<div class="section-title">4. Risk statistics</div>
<p>
All statistics are computed on <strong>trading days only</strong> (the calendar of the equity benchmark),
from the daily NAV series, and are shown once 60 trading days are available.
</p>
<div class="kv">
<b>Volatility</b><span>Standard deviation of daily returns × √252.</span>
<b>Sharpe ratio</b><span>Annualised mean excess return ÷ annualised volatility, risk-free rate 5%.</span>
<b>Max drawdown</b><span>Largest peak-to-trough decline of the NAV series.</span>
<b>VaR 95% (1-day)</b><span>Historical: the 5th percentile of daily returns.</span>
<b>Beta</b><span>Regression slope of portfolio daily returns on the secondary benchmark's daily returns.</span>
<b>Correlation</b><span>Pairwise correlation of the constituents' daily returns over the trailing 12 months (or since inception).</span>
</div>

<div class="section-title">5. Trades</div>
<p>
Every trade is recorded with its timestamp, price, size and rationale, and mirrored in a public post.
Reinforcements average the cost basis; trims and closes keep it. After each execution the tool re-reads
the database and flags any trade that did not land. The portfolio pages show current weights (market
value ÷ NAV), not target weights.
</p>

<div class="section-title">6. Corporate actions</div>
<div class="kv">
<b>Splits</b><span>Applied at the split ratio to shares and cost basis — value-neutral. The nightly job refuses to write a position whose value would jump more than 2.5× overnight, the signature of an unapplied split.</span>
<b>Dividends</b><span>Not credited to NAV (see §3). Reinvested in the per-position "Return %".</span>
<b>Mergers, delistings, ticker changes</b><span>Handled manually at the terms of the transaction and logged as trades.</span>
</div>

<div class="section-title">7. Monthly reports</div>
<p>
Reports are generated from the ledger at each month-end close (the numbers can be re-derived at any time)
and completed with a management commentary. A report without commentary is a draft and is not published.
